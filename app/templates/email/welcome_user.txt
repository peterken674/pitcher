Hi {{user.fname}},

In life, you only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you. How do we make sure that you use your 1 minute to actually say something meaningful?

Pitcher allows you to use that one minute wisely. You will submit your one minute pitch and other users will vote on it and leave comments to give their feedback on it.The pitches are organized by category.

Happy pitching!
Pitcher Ken.
